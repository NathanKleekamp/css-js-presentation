Introduction

Thank you all for coming.

In September I had the opportunitity to attend two frontend conferences in
Berlin: CSS Conf EU and JS Conf EU.

The first conference I attended was CSS Conf EU. It was a one day, single track
conference and the first of its kind in the EU. There were 11 speakers and
probably about 75 attendees.

There aren't many conferences with CSS as the focus, and because the organizers
did such an excellent job designing and running this conference, it was a rare
treat. The talks were a good mix of what's coming, css experiments, security
(yes, you heard that right), and best practices.

Compared with CSS Conf, JS Conf felt huge. It was a two-day, two-track
conference with about 300 attendees and speakers.

It was an exciting and inspiring experience. I had the opportunity to see devs
doing a lot of cool stuff, mostly with new APIs handed down to us from browser
manufacturers and standards bodies.

What follows are some of the talks I thought most important or inspiring. Let's
get into it, shall we!
